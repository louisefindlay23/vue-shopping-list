# Vue Shopping List

## About Vue Shopping List

My first Vue.js web app, Vue Shopping List is a basic shopping list created using the front-end JavaScript framework, Vue.js. Users can add items to the list using the text input element and click on them (to signal they have purchased an item) and cross it off their list.

## Future Functionality

- Add functionality to delete items
- Finish priority system
- Allow users to store links to where they can buy items
- Allow users to email their list
- Support multiple lists

## V2 - MEVN Stack

- Convert to a Node.js web app
- Add user accounts through Passport - Local
- Store lists in a MongoDB Atlas database
